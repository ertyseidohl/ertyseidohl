I'm a full-stack web engineer, and I really do mean full-stack: I love working with everything from hardware to JavaScript. I graduated from Lawrence University with a double major English + Math/CS bachelors, and then attended [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) in 2013. 

Since 2009, I've worked at a variety of tech companies, most recently Google (2018-2024). Most recently I've been working as a contractor on assignment with Google's Tech Equity team, updating college CS curriculum to include GenAI. I have a lot of thoughts about GenAI in education, feel free to ask me!

In addition to software development, I've run my own web development contracting business, taught programming in a variety of environments, and managed my own web hosting since ~2001.

I helped run [!!Con](https://bangbangcon) - a radically inclusive conference about the joy, excitement, and surprise of computing - from 2014 until the last one in 2024.

My curriculum development contract is expiring soon, and I'm looking to get back into non-contracting work. Bonus points if it's education or climate related! Reach out via the email on my homepage.

## Technologies

I've got extensive experience with:

* Web (HTML5, CSS, JS), Python, Node.js, TypeScript, SQL, testing, and technical writing.

* Data Structures & Algorithms (CS Degree, gave 100 interviews at Google, studied them on my own)

* Using GenAI (Google Gemini, Github Copilot) 

I have some experience with:

* Java, Dart, React, Vue.js, Haskell, Electron, SCSS, Bazel, Phaser, Lua, Docker, Image/video processing, as well as project management and engineering management.

* I'm currently exploring hardware, especially Arduino.

I've used but am very rusty with:
